<h2> Purpose </h2>
<p> This project will be used to publish and experiment with things that I love. 
  Many of these projects had been previously resigned to being local solutions that are quickly forgotten and antiquated.
  To help remedy this (and rejuvenate my GitHub activity), this will help me compile my work into a single space.
  For anyone reading this, these are the things I am passionate about to the point where I needed to share it with you! </p>
